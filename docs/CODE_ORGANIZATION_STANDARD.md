# Code Organization Standard Manual

## Introduction
This document outlines the standards for organizing class files within our project to ensure consistency, readability, and maintainability.

## Alphabetical Ordering
- Classes should be organized in alphabetical order to facilitate easy navigation and discovery.
- This applies to both file names and class names to ensure that related classes are grouped together logically.

## Sectioning
- Related classes should be grouped together into sections, with each section clearly defined in the documentation.
- Use comments to denote section boundaries, which will enhance clarity for new contributors.

## Naming Conventions
- Class names should be descriptive and follow the CamelCase naming convention.
- File names should match the class names and be in lowercase with words separated by underscores (e.g., `my_class_name.py`).
- Avoid abbreviations unless they are well-known and commonly accepted.

## Benefits of This Approach
- **Improved Readability**: Well-organized code is easier to read and understand, reducing the cognitive load on developers.
- **Easier Maintenance**: When classes are organized consistently, it makes it simpler to locate and modify code.
- **Enhanced Collaboration**: New contributors can more easily understand the structure of the project, leading to a smoother onboarding process.

## Conclusion
Following these standards will lead to a more efficient development process and a more maintainable codebase.

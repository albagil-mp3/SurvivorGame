 * Mutable value object that encapsulates the physical state of a VObject at a

 * This object belongs strictly to the physics domain and contains no logic
 * beyond data representation. It is used by the simulation model to track and
 * propagate physical values without exposing mutable state.
 *
 * Poolable: This DTO is reused from a pool to reduce allocation pressure during
 * physics calculations. It is mutable to support efficient updates via updateFrom().
